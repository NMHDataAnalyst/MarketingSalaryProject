# MarketingSalaryProject
I used Beautiful Soup in Python to scrape 500 entry-level marketing job posts from the TopCV website. I then processed and cleaned the data using Excel, removing any outliers to obtain the most accurate results, resulting in 325 job posts. Finally, I utilized Power BI to create charts that best represented insights into the average salary of entry-level marketing positions, the average salary among different marketing sectors, the discrepancy in the number of job posts among regions and between Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi.
Thank you for taking the time to review my project. I am constantly learning and improving my skills in data analysis and visualization, and this project was a great opportunity for me to practice and apply what I have learned. I hope that the insights provided by my analysis will be useful for anyone interested in the entry-level marketing job market in Vietnam. If you have any feedback or suggestions for me, I would greatly appreciate hearing them. Thank you again for your time and consideration.
